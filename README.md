# UltraEpic Entity Framework

This will be an open source entity framework for games.  Written in Java so that I have something for my resume to demonstrate my knowledge of this highly marketable programming language.  Contribute to this project if you would like it on your resume too ;-)

This will also contain an example game, specifically a text adventure, also titled Ultra Epic.
